# Real-Time Fraud Detection Algorithm with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a real-time fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to analyze transactional data and identify fraudulent activities as they occur. The model uses various algorithms for anomaly detection and pattern recognition, helping financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and payment systems to reduce fraud-related losses.

## Features
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: The system processes transactions in real-time and flags suspicious activities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers and patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Alert System**: Generates alerts for flagged transactions for immediate action.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the model.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data processing and manipulation.
- **Flask/Django**: For serving the machine learning model as a web API.
- **Kafka**: Optional, for real-time data streaming (if implementing a production-grade system).
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Optional, for deep learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical transactional data with features such as transaction amount, user ID, device type, transaction time, and more. It has been preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective baseline for fraud detection.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble technique to improve classification accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm for enhanced performance on imbalanced datasets.
- **Neural Networks (Optional)**: Deep learning approach to capture complex patterns in the data.
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised algorithm for anomaly detection.

## Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
The first step is to clean the raw transactional data. This involves:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Identifying and filling or removing missing values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and addressing any outliers or incorrect data points that may impact model performance.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensuring all data is in the correct format for analysis (e.g., converting date columns to `datetime` type).

### 2. Feature Selection
- **Identifying Relevant Features**: Selecting important features from the raw data that contribute most to detecting fraudulent transactions (e.g., transaction amount, user ID, device type).
- **Removing Redundant Features**: Dropping features that provide little to no additional information, such as unique transaction IDs.
  
### 3. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is essential for improving model performance. This step includes:
- **Creating Interaction Features**: Generating new features based on interactions between existing variables (e.g., transaction amount by time of day).
- **Aggregating Features**: Creating rolling averages, or aggregating data at a user level (e.g., total transactions per user over a specific period).
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: Converting categorical features (e.g., device type) into numeric representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 4. Variable Creation
Based on domain knowledge or the patterns observed in the data, new variables may be created, such as:
- **Fraud History**: A binary feature indicating whether the user has been flagged for fraud in the past.
- **Transaction Frequency**: Number of transactions a user has made in the last 30 days.
- **Transaction Velocity**: Time between consecutive transactions for a user.

### 5. Model Training
Train multiple machine learning models using the preprocessed and engineered data. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks can be trained and evaluated on the data.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Once trained, evaluate the model using common classification metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### 7. Model Deployment
Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed for real-time fraud detection:

- **API Deploymen**t: Use Flask or Django to deploy the model as a RESTful API that can handle real-time predictions.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Set up a pipeline where transactional data is passed to the API, and the model returns a prediction (fraudulent or not).
- **Alert System**: Integrate the prediction API with an alerting system to notify stakeholders of potential fraud.
